          <p>Critical Incident Management Team</p>
          <p>
            In the event of a critical incident, the
            <span>Principal/Headmaster/Headmistress</span> will establish a
            Critical Incident Management Team (CIMT). The CIMT is responsible
            for assisting the <span>Principal/Headmaster/Headmistress</span> in
            responding to and managing the critical incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            CIMT members will include representatives from the
            <span>Management / Executive Team</span> and other senior staff as
            needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Depending on the nature of the critical incident, the composition of
            the CIMT may vary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Formulating and Implementing a Critical Incident Management Plan
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst each critical incident and/or traumatic event will have its
            own unique circumstances and management issues, the following basic
            guidelines apply when formulating and implementing a Critical
            Incident Management Plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that these steps do not need to be
            undertaken in order and that one or more of these steps may be in
            operation simultaneously. Major incidents may require the engagement
            of external parties to assist in coordinating the
            <span>School/College</span>’s response.
          </p>

            Step 1 – Contact
            <span>Principal/Headmaster/Headmistress</span> (CIMT Leader)
          </h1>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <h1 id="heading-uId-20">
            Step 2 – Assemble Critical Incident Management Team (CIMT)
          </h1>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            It is critical that CIMT members have each other’s contact details
            entered into their mobile phones to ensure that there are no delays
            in coordinating the initial CIMT meeting.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the initial CIMT meeting an initial Critical Incident Management
            Plan will be developed having regard to the steps outlined in this
            Policy.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h1 id="heading-uId-21">
            Step 3 – Initiate Communications with Relevant People/Authorities
          </h1>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            In some circumstances it will be necessary to contact relevant
            people or authorities, such as the police or other emergency
            services, to establish the most up to date information relating to
            the relevant situation as this may have a bearing on the response
            plan that is to be undertaken.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h1 id="heading-uId-22">
            Step 4 – Establish an Incident Support Team/Support Team Centre (If
            Required)
          </h1>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            In some circumstances it may be necessary to draw on additional
            personnel/resources and establish a specific incident support team
            and support team centre. This is particularly important where
            multiple critical tasks are to be coordinated simultaneously and the
            situation is ongoing.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h1 id="heading-uId-23">Step 5 – Staff Briefing</h1>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            All <span>School/College</span> staff should be briefed as to the
            situation as quickly as possible to ensure that they are able to
            respond appropriately to any queries raised by students or
            parents/carers. Depending on the nature of the situation this
            briefing may be via email, text message or a staff meeting.
          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure that all staff can be contacted as quickly as possible, a
            <span>School/College</span> mobile phone or other facility should be
            set up with a group contact including each member of staff's mobile
            phone number. This staff group contact will enable text messages to
            be disseminated rapidly. An up to date all staff email group should
            also be established and maintained, to allow more detailed
            communications to be disseminated as required.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h1 id="heading-uId-24">
            Step 6 – Communicate with Students/Parents and Carers
          </h1>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            A communications strategy should be established to ensure clear and
            accurate communications with both parents/carers and students. Refer
            to
            <a href="/module/7/page/undefined"

          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h1 id="heading-uId-25">Step 7 – Arrange for Counselling Services</h1>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The need for counselling services will be dependent on the nature of
            the incident and the extent of its impact across the
            <span>School/College</span> community. Where it is necessary to
            engage external assistance, this will be coordinated through the
            CIMT.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h1 id="heading-uId-26">
            Step 8 – Refine Critical Incident Management Response Plan
          </h1>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            During major ongoing incidents it is likely that the Critical
            Incident Response Plan will be updated frequently. The CIMT will be
            responsible for refining the Critical Incident Management Response
            Plan and communicating relevant information to key stakeholders as
            required.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h1 id="heading-uId-27">Step 9 – Post Event Follow Up</h1>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The effects of traumatic events can have long term consequences
            which require long term monitoring and response. Once the initial
            Critical Incident Response Plan has been implemented, it is
            important to monitor and respond to the requirements of the
            <span>School/College</span> community over time.
