                  Glass is fragile and subject to breakage. When glass breaks it
                  has the potential to cause injury, not only to those who are
                  tasked with the responsibility of cleaning up the breakage,
                  but also to others who may be cut by broken glass if it is not
                  cleaned up and disposed of effectively.

                  area. The method of isolation will depend on the situation and
                  the perceived risk of injury. This may involve asking
                  bystanders to create a “human barrier” to the danger area
                  while others undertake the clean up, or placing signs around
                  the debris to warn people.

                    tape or other heavy tape. The boxes of broken glass can be
